## About Me:
My name is Matt Gubernick,  Iâ€™m a full-stack web developer and software engineer.  I have a background in Post Production Audio Engineering & Sound Design. I most recently worked in the hospitality industry creating and facilitating meetings and events for both individuals and big companies. These industries merged my interests in collaboration, problem solving and efficiency, continual learning and creative thinking. I was able to work with coworkers and clients to turn vision into reality and problem solve creatively, efficiently, and in real time. The time spent in these prior industries and experiences and skills  gained in the  General Assembly program helped solidify my excitement for pursuing a new adventure in the world of development.

Similar to my career and professional  interests, you can find me in my free time practicing and competing with the Professional Ultimate Frisbee team, Chicago Union. Otherwise you'll probably find me biking around the Chicagoland area or indoors playing guitar, bass, ukulele, mandolin or working on puzzles (both computer/software based and physical game puzzles) with a cup of coffee newar by.

I hope to work for  a company where I can not only continue to grow as a developer but also continue to utilize my creative problem solving skills in an exciting, fun and  collaborative environment.
